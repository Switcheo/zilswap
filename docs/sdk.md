# SDK

A TypeScript SDK to easily integrate your dApp with Zilswap can be found at [https://github.com/Switcheo/zilswap-sdk](https://github.com/Switcheo/zilswap-sdk).

This SDK allows integrators to easily interface with the Zilswap smart contract without needing to do conversions between human and unitless numbers.

It also provides a set of getters to retrieve and monitor the Zilswap smart contract state.

Finally, it provides exchange rate calculations and converts limits and thresholds from a human understandable input into the format that the Zilswap smart contract requires.
