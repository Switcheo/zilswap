# Introduction {docsify-ignore-all}

Zilswap is a fully decentralized protocol for ZRC-2 token exchanges on Zilliqa.

Zilswap makes use of an Autonomous Market Maker based on the Constant Product Formula (x * y = k) first proposed by [V. Buterin](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/55m04x/lets_run_onchain_decentralized_exchanges_the_way/).

Holders of ZRC-2 tokens and ZIL tokens can contribute to the corresponding liquidity pool in order to back the liquidity pools, and will receive the fee of 0.3% on each swap.

Users and dApps may use the protocol to swap between any 2 tokens without any middlemen.
Because the swap is done against the liquidity pools, there is no need to wait for a counterparty,
and transactions can be done completely on-chain.

## Getting Started

Users who wish to swap between two ZRC-2 or ZIL tokens or join a liquidity pool can directly use the [Zilswap](https://zilswap.io) dApp.

dApp integraters should check out the Smart Contract [documentation](smart-contract) and may use our TypeScript [SDK](sdk) for quick integration.

## How It Works
